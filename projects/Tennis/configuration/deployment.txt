1. the application requires java 1.6+ (at least jasypt will not work without addition configuration with java < 1.6)
2. I'm using jasypt to encrypt sensible properties in properties files like password. To decrypt those encrypted
properties the application need to know what password was used to encrypt them. The application expects
 that tha password is stored in environment variable called 'jasypt.password'.
